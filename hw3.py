# Specification: newPop(config) creates a new population agents. A
# population is an N-element tuple of agents, where each agent is
# represented by a dictionary with two entries. The 'state' of the
# agent (-1 <= s <= di+de) represents that agent's current disease
# condition, while the agent's 'vaccine' status (a Boolean) represents
# whether the agent has been vaccinated or not.
#
# Returns a tuple of agent dictionaries, where I agents, selected at
# random, are initially infected (disease state = di+de+1); all other
# agents are marked as susceptible (disease state = -1). 
#
# We also set the agent's vaccination state.  To get the behavior we
# want, we'll flip a weighted coin to determine whether the person is
# chooses to vaccinate, and, if so, set the effectiveness of that
# vaccine to a random value between 0 and 1. Those who elect to remain
# unvaccinated get an effectiveness of 0.
#
# A similar process is followed for masking; do they choose to mask,
# and if so, with what frequency? Non-masking agents get a frequency
# of 0.
#
# When selecting the I infected agents, we use a similar process to
# determine whether that agent is asymptomatic, and, if they are, we
# set their social isolation to 0 (they don't know to
# isolate). Otherwise, we'll set their social isolation depending on
# whether they choose to isolate, and, if so, with what frequency?

# Specification: sim(cfile='hw3.cfg') returns a list of integers,
# where each integer represents the number of infections on the
# corresponding simulation day (i.e., the pandemic curve). There are a
# large number of parameters, all with default values:
#   N: number of agents in the simulation
#   I: number of infections during simulation; initially,
#      the number of infected agents on day 1.
#   m: mixing parameter is the max number of daily interactions initiated
#      by a given agent: randint(0,m) generates a given day's tally.
#   vp: probability that an agent has been vaccinated
#   tp: tuple of transmission probabilities; first value corresponds
#       to the shedding rate while exposed, the second to the shedding
#       rate while infected (generally higher).
#   de: number of days agent remains in exposed state
#   di: number of days agent remains in infected state
#   rp: probability of recovery (as opposed to becoming susceptible again)
#   max: failsafe simulation time limit, in days
#   config['verbose']: Boolean value toggles user feedback
#
# A few more words about how we use our simple infection model (see
# Carrat et al, 2008).  People are exposed for de days (the exposed
# period), then infected for di additional days (the infected period):
# they are infectious (that is, they can infect others) while they are
# either exposed or infected.  We'll use a "daily countdown" to model
# each agent's disease state.
#
# Agents generally start the simulation as susceptible, that is, a
# status of -1. If they are infected on day t, we assume their exposed
# period runs for de days starting the next day, t+1, and then their
# infected period starts on day t+de and runs for di days. At the
# beginning of each day, update() updates each agent's infection
# status.
#
# Carrat et al. (2008) indicate E~2 and I~7 for influenza, so let's
# see a concrete example how this works. At infection on dy t, we set
# the agent's state to di+de+1 (the extra 1 ensures the agent enters
# the infectious range on the day following infectoin, after the
# beginning-of-day status update). After the infection has run its
# course, update() flips a coin to decide if the agent is now immune
# (recovered, 0) or becomes susceptible once again (-1).
#

#   SUS REC                   I    I+E I+E+1
